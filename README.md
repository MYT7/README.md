* **Refining the "Safe Mode" Code:**
    * Header: Text H1/H2.
    * Intro: Text.
    * Skills: `shields.io` badges (static raster images are safer than SVGs sometimes, but Shields IO is SVG usually. Let's try `style=flat` or just standard badges).
    * *Self-Correction:* The user's screenshot shows *everything* broken, even `typing-svg`. This suggests a severe network blockage for these domains.
    * **Decision:** I will create a **"Text-Based + Standard Images"** profile. No Vercel/Heroku links.
    * I will use images uploaded to GitHub or reliable CDNs if possible? No, I can't upload for them.
    * I will use **standard Emoji and Text Tables**. This is 100% fail-proof.

* **Let's try one last "High Quality" attempt with a different mirror or method?** No, the user is angry. I need reliability.
* **Plan:**
    1.  Explain that the external servers (Vercel/Heroku) are blocked for them/GitHub proxy.
    2.  Provide a **"Static/Safe"** version.
    3.  Use Emoji for "Trophies".
    4.  Use `shields.io` for badges (these usually work, but if they fail, I'll provide a text alternative). *Actually, let's look at the screenshot again.* The `tech stack` section in the screenshot shows broken images too. If `skillicons.dev` is blocked, I should use standard text lists or bullet points.
    5.  **Wait**, the screenshots show `skillicons.dev` might be broken too.
    6.  **Pivot:** I will make a purely **Markdown & Emoji** based profile. It will look like a "Terminal" or "Report" but without relying on external image fetching. This ensures 100% uptime.

* **Drafting the "Fail-Proof" Profile:**
    * Header: ASCII Art or Text Block.
    * Bio: Blockquote.
    * Stats: Manual text list (e.g., "🔥 Python Expert", "🚀 CEO").
    * Tech Stack: Table with Names + Emoji (e.g., "🐍 Python", "⚛️ React").
    * Connect: Text Links.

* **Second Option:** I will try `shields.io` again but with a different domain/style? No, Shields is usually robust. The user's screenshot showed `skillicons.dev` failed.
* Let's give them a **"Pure Text/Emoji/Markdown"** version that looks stylish but requires **zero** external requests.

* **Response Structure:**
    1.  Acknowledge the broken images are due to filtering/blocking of those specific services.
    2.  Present the **"Anti-Filter / Offline Mode"** code.
    3.  It uses pure Markdown, Tables, and Emojis. No external server calls that can fail.
